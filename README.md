# GraphView

GraphView is a CAD-like application designed for creating, visualizing, and analyzing graphs. It supports both directed and undirected graphs, as well as weighted edges. You can execute a variety of graph algorithms with step-by-step animations. Graphs can be serialized into JSON files for easy reuse.

This project also serves as a proof of concept for my lightweight graph library, [CppGraphLite](https://github.com/thisDotLucas/CppGraphLite), which enables the underlying graph operations and algorithms.
